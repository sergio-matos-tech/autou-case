Subject: Following up on Project Phoenix - Action Required for API Credentials

Hi Team,

I'm following up on the integration task for Project Phoenix. I've completed the initial setup of the staging environment as per the project plan.

However, I'm currently blocked as I still need the production API credentials for the payment gateway service. The documentation mentions these need to be generated by the security team.

Could you please let me know the status of this request or who I should contact directly to get this resolved? My task ID is PHOENIX-182.

Thanks,
Alex Chen
